## Introduction
In the aftermath of the January 2025 Eaton and Palisades wildfires in Los Angeles County, assessing the remaining capacities of debris basins is critical for forecasting potential hazards associated with upcoming rain events. This report provides a low-cost, effecient assessment of debris basin capacities using UAV-based lidar surveys conducted before and after rainfall events. By leveraging high-resolution topographic data, we quantify sediment accumulation and estimate the remaining capacity of debris basins in the wildfire-affected regions. The results from this study are intended to support emergency management agencies in prioritizing debris basin cleanouts and forecasting potential debris flow risks for upcoming storm events.

## Methodology

### Data Collection
To conduct high-resolution surveys of debris basins, we utilized the following equipment:

- **Unpiloted Aerial Vehicle (UAV):** DJI Matrice 350 RTK, a high-precision drone with real-time kinematic (RTK) capabilities for accurate georeferencing.
- **Lidar Sensor:**  DJI Zenmuse L2, a high-resolution lidar system optimized for topographic mapping and terrain modeling. With its five-return capability, this lidar sensor enables effective vegetation filtering. 
- **RTK GPS Base:** Emlid Reach RS3, a multi-band GNSS receiver used for precise ground control point measurements.
Power System: DJI BS65 Intelligent Battery Station with five pairs of DJI TB65 batteries, ensuring extended flight operations. A portable power generator is also used to recharge batteries in the field, allowing for continuous operation by alternating battery usage efficiently.
- **Software:** DJI Terra, used for lidar data processing, point cloud generation, and bare ground classification.

We conducted UAV surveys at an altitude of 100â€“120 meters above ground level, utilizing the terrain-following feature to maintain a consistent ground sampling resolution. This approach resulted in a 3.5 cm / pixel resolution and a point density of 500-700 points / $m^2$. We set an 80% front overlap and a 20% lateral overlap between data frames. Additionally, RGB image collection during surveys was enabled to colorize the point clouds. The UAV operated at a maximum speed of 15 m/s, with an average flight speed of 6 m/s.

We collected UAV LiDAR data from debris basins affected by the Eaton wildfire to assess post-fire sediment accumulation and remaining basin capacity. Table 1 provides an overview of the surveys conducted, including flight dates and locations. Figure 1 illustrate points clouds from the UAV lidar surveys and data processing.
